# Hi, I'm Manoj Savukar 👋

**Senior Azure DevOps Engineer & Cloud Infrastructure Specialist** | Driving Enterprise Digital Transformation through **Infrastructure as Code** & **Automation**

---

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a results-driven **Azure DevOps Engineer** with **3+ years** of hands-on experience designing, automating, and optimizing enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. My mission is to transform complex infrastructure challenges into elegant, scalable, and secure cloud solutions using **Infrastructure as Code** best practices.

### 🎯 My Story
Starting my DevOps journey, I discovered that the real power isn't just in managing infrastructure—it's in **automating it away**. Today, I specialize in building modular, reusable infrastructure frameworks that enable development teams to deploy confidently, consistently, and at scale. I've evolved from supporting infrastructure deployments to architecting **production-ready, enterprise-grade solutions** that reduce deployment time from weeks to hours.

### 💡 What I Do
- 🏗️ **Design & Deploy** enterprise cloud architectures on Azure with zero-knowledge secret management
- ⚙️ **Automate Everything** using Terraform, ARM Templates, and GitHub Actions for reproducible infrastructure
- 🐳 **Orchestrate Containers** with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Helm, and GitOps principles
- 🔄 **Build CI/CD Pipelines** that enable rapid, reliable, and repeatable deployments
- 📊 **Monitor & Optimize** infrastructure using Prometheus, Grafana, and cloud-native observability tools
- 🤝 **Mentor & Share** DevOps practices with engineers and help shape cloud-native culture
